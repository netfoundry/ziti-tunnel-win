# Release 1.8.0

## What's New
* DNS resolution has *CHANGED*. Users have had issues with the proxied DNS requests at times leading to an
  experience that was frustrating at time. Restarting the client fixed the problem but is also not what we want.
  Now the Ziti Desktop Edge for Windows will add NRPT rules and only send intercepted services to the resolver.
  The resolver will still proxy requests it does not know but fewer requests should need to be made to the internal
  DNS resolver.
* The internal DNS resolver no longer needs to be the primary DNS resolver on all interfaces due to the change
  mentioned above
